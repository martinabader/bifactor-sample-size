## Preliminaries

This tutorial relies on the R packages `simsem` and `lavaan`. 

Before continuing, make sure that these packages have been installed and activated with the command `library(simsem)`.

In addition, a costum function labeled `summaryECV` is used which is not part of the `simsem` package. Please download this function from the tutorial folder and load the function into your R project using the command `source('summaryECV.R')`


## Model Specification

### Defining the population model

First, you need to define the population model for which you would like to determine the required sample size. The population model will be used by `simsem` for data generation. Our example model is a bifactor model with one general factor and three specific factors with three indicators each. You also need to specify the values of all parameters of the population model by relying on theoretical assumptions or prior research findings. In our example, all general factors loadings are .60 and all specific factor loadings are .40. The residual variances of each indicator can be found by subtracting the squared factor loadings from 1. The variances of the latent factors were set to 1 so that all parameters are in a standardized metric. In line with the standard specification of bifactor models, orthogonality between the specific factors and the general factor as well as among the specific factors is assumed. The model is specified via the syntax style of lavaan as follows: 

``` r
populationModel <- '

  # define loadings
  G =~ .6*y1 + .6*y2 + .6*y3 + .6*y4 + .6*y5 + .6*y6 + .6*y7 + .6*y8 + .6*y9
  S1 =~ .4*y1 + .4*y2 + .4*y3
  S2 =~ .4*y4 + .4*y5 + .4*y6
  S3 =~ .4*y7 + .4*y8 + .4*y9
  
  # define residual variances of indicators (= 1 - .6^2 - .4^2)
  y1 ~~ .48*y1
  y2 ~~ .48*y2
  y3 ~~ .48*y3
  y4 ~~ .48*y4
  y5 ~~ .48*y5
  y6 ~~ .48*y6
  y7 ~~ .48*y7
  y8 ~~ .48*y8
  y9 ~~ .48*y9
  
  # set factor variances to 1 (so that loadinGS are in a standardized metric)
  G ~~ 1*G
  S1 ~~ 1*S1
  S2 ~~ 1*S2
  S3 ~~ 1*S3
  
  # define factors to be orthoGonal
  S1 + S2 + S3 ~~ 0*G
  S1 + S2 ~~ 0*S3
  S1 ~~ 0*S2
'
```


### Defining the analysis model

Next, we define the analysis model that will be used by `simsem` to analyse the generated data. The analysis model defines the general model structure but does not impose specific parameter values. Our analysis model correctly represents the structure of the population model

``` r
analysisModel <- '
  G =~ NA*y1 + y2 + y3 + y4 + y5 + y6 + y7 + y8 + y9
  S1 =~ NA*y1 + y2 + y3
  S2 =~ NA*y4 + y5 + y6
  S3 =~ NA*y7 + y8 + y9
  
  S1 + S2 + S3 ~~ 0*G
  S1 + S2 ~~ 0*S3
  S1 ~~ 0*S2
  
  G ~~ 1*G
  S1 ~~ 1*S1
  S2 ~~ 1*S2
  S3 ~~ 1*S3
'
```

## Run Simulation

Now, we can run a Monte Carlo simulation by using the `sim` command:

``` r
results <- sim(n = 150, generate = populationModel, model = analysisModel, lavaanfun = "sem", nRep = 500, completeRep = 5000, seed = 2021)

```
In the `n` argument, we specify that a sample size of 150 observations should be used. The population model and analysis model are supplied to the `generate` and `model` arguments, respectively. The `lavaanfun` defines the name of the function that is used for data analysis (here, the `sem` function of lavaan). The number of simulation replications (`nRep`) is set to 500, which tells `simsem` that we aim to have a minimum of 500 properly converged solutions. We also set that the maximum number of simulation replications (`completeRep`) to 5,000, meaning that the simulation should stop after 5000 replications even if our target number of 500 proper solutions has not been reached. The `seed` function can be used for reproducibility.
